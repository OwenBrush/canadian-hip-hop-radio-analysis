## Outline

- This data was originally prepared to support someone's PHD thesis
- I have created visualizations of the data in order to draw out insights based on the demographic qualities of artists and stations 


## Distribution and characteristic of data:

![Distribution of plays by station](/images/plays_by_station.png)

- #### Records of songs played at a given station are collected on a weekly basis, 10 at a time.
- #### The frequency of the records vary greatly from station to station

![Distribution of plays by chart position](/images/plays_by_chart_position.png)

- #### Each selection of 10 songs from a radio station includes 1 song from each chart position
- #### April and May generally have better reporting
- #### There is rarely data from the holiday period at the end of december

![Distribution of plays by province](/images/plays_by_province.png)

- #### The data is heavily weighted towards Ontario
- #### Data from stations inNew Brunswick and Nova Scotia is mostly absent for the second half of the time period

## Insights:

![Distribution of gender by nationalitt](/images/chart_artist_gender_by_nationality.png)

- #### There is a signifigantly larger proportion of female artists from the UK than other nationalities.

![Distribution of race by province](/images/chart_bipoc_by_province.png)

- #### The amount of BIPOC artists that get air time is roughly even across the provinces except for Nova Scotia which plays a signifigantly larger proportion of white artists.

![Distribution of canadian content by province](/images/chart_cancon_by_province.png)

- #### The amount of Canadian artists that get air time is roughly even across the provinces except for Nova Scotia which plays a signifigantly larger proportion of Canadian Artists.

![Distribution of race by nationality](/images/chart_station_plays_nationality.png)

- #### There is a signifigantly larger proportion of black artists from the USA than other nationalities
- #### There is a signifigantly larger proportion of ethnically asian or middle eastern artists from the UK and internationally

![Correlation of artist data](/images/correlation_artist.png)

- #### There is a moderate negative correlation between Canadian Content and visable ethnic minority, meaning that Canadian artists that get played are more likely to be white.
- #### There is a subtle positive correlation between Canadian Content and total plays, meaning that Canadian artists tend to get played more often.
